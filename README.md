# Lambda-Banking-App

Technical summary
This section contains the layout of contents documented herein. The key features of this application can be broken down into three main concepts: user experience, safety transactions, and efficient database transactions. User experience taken into account in this project, the front-end interface ensures the usability of the application. As with any other banking applications, security is a must, hence the back-end ensures safely encrypted transactions between users. Finally, the relational database is implemented via local SQL connections. In the succeeding sections, we delve into the program specification, rationale, and delimitations of the project.
